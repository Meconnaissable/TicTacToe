# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

Build a small web application where you can play tic tac toe. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

 
# Technology stack:
·    React
·    JS               
Only in the browser, no server required


# Requirements:   

·    Two players can play tic tac toe and the web app can handle the game rules

·    The game displays who won.

·    The game offers the possibility to start a new game

·    No special multiplayer handling: Two players can play this game by just using the same input device (e.g. mouse)

·    The focus lies on the code and not on the design. The webpage only needs to be functional. 

It would be good if the code is accessible via some git repository. And of course, if you have any further questions feel free to contact me!


Κeep in mind that quality is more important than just trying to solve this challenge as fast as possible.
